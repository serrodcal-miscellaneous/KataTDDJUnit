# KataTDDJUnit
Example of TDD Kata

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers) <br />
a. The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2” <br />
b. Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers <br />
c. Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
d. Remember to refactor after each passing test <br />

2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
